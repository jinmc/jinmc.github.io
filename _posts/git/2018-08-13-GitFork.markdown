This is something new and what I haven't done before, probably because 
I haven't worked much with someone else's work.
<br><br>
Forking is not a git command, it's a github concept, which lets you 
to duplicate the remote repository to my remote repository. So <b>git fork</b>
command would not work. You have to fork from the github.
<br><br>
So to get a sense why we need a fork, 
if we clone a github that is not ours, and try to push an update,
it won't work because we don't have authorization.
<br><br>
So to make changes to the project,
we can fork it and make it our own changes in our own github repository!
<br><br>
When you want to contribute to the original post, we can do a pull request.
This is kind of confusing, but it can be understood as the original post's perspective,
they're pulling what I've coded, so it makes sense.
<br><br>
Just keep in mind that when making contributions,
check the issue page (which will be a markdown) 
and make a new issue that you are not wasting your time with 
a thing someone else is also doing.
