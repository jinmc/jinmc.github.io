Reference : Udacity Github and Collaboration course

This is something new and what I haven't done before, probably because 
I haven't worked much with someone else's work.
<br><br>
Forking is not a git command, it's a github concept, which lets you 
to duplicate the remote repository to my remote repository. So <b>git fork</b>
command would not work. You have to fork from the github.
<br><br>
So to get a sense why we need a fork, 
if we clone a github that is not ours, and try to push an update,
it won't work because we don't have authorization.
<br><br>
So to make changes to the project,
we can fork it and make it our own changes in our own github repository!
