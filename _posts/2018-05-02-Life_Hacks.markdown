This is actually not a coding related post but I just realized this is not only regarding to 23 years old 
but to everyone, even for me. I am refering this from a quora post and the link is here :
https://www.quora.com/What-should-I-know-be-doing-at-23-years-old

I am 29, going on 30. Below is a list that I wish I had known at 23.

1. Networking is important. Everyone needs sponsors and advocates if they want to achieve greater heights in their career, the sooner you start creating a network of people that can support and nurture you, the better.
2. Not every friend is important. Some exist just to feed off your insecurities and lower your self worth. Surround yourself with people who want the best for you. Don’t be afraid to drop people who do not want to see you succeed.
3. A real relationship will happen. Wait for it, give it time. Don’t settle for anything less than you deserve, It’s worth it.
4. There are sharks in this world. Stay aware about the sharks who want to feed off your naïveté and kindness. Be kind, but firm. Balance is the key.
5. Everyone works on their own timelines. Some people become successful much earlier than others. Just because it’s not your time, do not stop preparing for when your time comes. A little preparation goes a long way.
6. Exercise. Eat healthy. Quit the booze already. Health is paramount. You cannot enjoy anything else, be it career, wealth or family, if you are not healthy.
7. Spend more and more time with your loved ones and friends that matter. We think we have forever, but we don’t.
8. Don’t try to stick to adolescence. You are an adult, better start behaving like one. Maturity is pretty sexy. People like people who can hold intelligent conversations.
9. Get involved in country politics (even if it just means that you become aware about the candidates up for election from your area, and going to vote on the voting day). Politics and democracy is for everyone. If you do not represent you in the country politics, do not expect anyone else to represent you.
10. And while you do all this, don’t forget to have some fun! Life is shorter than we think it is, and the best years quickly pass by. Enjoy the present.
