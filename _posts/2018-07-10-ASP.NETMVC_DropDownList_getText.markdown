Webforms and MVC are very much different, even in simple things as creating a form and retrieving information from them.
In Webforms, creating dropdownlists was so easy...

{% highlight csharp %}
	<asp:DropDownList id = "itemDdl" runat="server">
		<asp:ListItem Text ="Item1" Value ="1"></asp:ListItem>
     		<asp:ListItem Text ="Item2" Value ="2"></asp:ListItem>
		<asp:ListItem Text ="Item3" Value ="3"></asp:ListItem>
	</asp:DropDownList>

{% endhighlight %}

you just put this on your frontend page and call it from the backend page by 
{% highlight csharp %}

	var text = itemDdl.SelectedText;
	var value = itemDdl.selectedValue;

{% endhighlight %}

And we could get the text or the value  whatever we like.

On the other hand, in MVC, it's not that easy.
I've tried, but but according to stack overflow, 
the way to do it is .. to use javascript, and it does not look pretty.

This is the stack overflow post explaining it how to do it...

it was so complicated I didn't even try.... 

I think there should be a better way.. 
just don't know how to do it.
