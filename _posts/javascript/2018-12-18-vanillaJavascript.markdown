This is a bit embarassing, but until now I thought
vanilla javascript was some kind of library.

It was today that I found out vanilla javascript meant just plain javascript.

I've been actually kind of turning my back on javascript, 
just doing stack-overflow coding on it, but now I think I've had it enough.
Using PHP and Laravel, it's great on the backend but there's no way 
I can use php for frontend. 

I was looking to do some thing in Javascript, and I was wondering to do it with
JQuery instead until I came across this article. https://snipcart.com/blog/learn-vanilla-javascript-before-using-js-frameworks.


It got me so inspiring I bought a Udemy course that it advertised,
which is Javascript and the weird parts.  https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/

And there, there are 3 main big words,
which is 

Syntax Parser, A program that  reads your code and determines 
what it does and if its grammar is valid

Lexical Environment, where something sits physically in the code you write
(lexical means having to do with words or grammar)

Execution context, a wrapper to help manage the code that is running
