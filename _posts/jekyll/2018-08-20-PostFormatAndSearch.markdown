As I see traffics on my blog 
I started to think .. is it possible to set up google adsense
and make some money here?
<br><br>
Of course, I'm not trying to make a lot of money here,
just trying to get a sense of it,
but as a F1 OPT status currently, I'm pretty afraid of the consequences
of it.
<br><br>
So I'll just share a link and leave it until I get confindence I can do this.
