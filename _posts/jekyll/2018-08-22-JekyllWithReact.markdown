I was never this excited about the post until now ...
As I become more and more familiar with Jekyll, 
I am actually enjoying it a lot that I can deploy with no cost 
and not have to handle the deploying details.. 

But I actually thought I was going to miss out a lot because 
it doesn't have a backend, but wait.. 
maybe not with javascript.. because you can do client side programming,
like React!?!?!?!?!??

so I started researching and found this article.

<i>https://medium.com/@allizadrozny/using-webpack-and-react-with-jekyll-cfe137f8a2cc</i>

According to the article,
we can use webpack, which is a bundler for javascript and others
and also npm to set up react envirnoment, and we're ready to go.
I would be happy to do this, 
and will add a component in this or wherever post whenever I'm ready.

So in short...

I'm gonna become one of the cool kids
