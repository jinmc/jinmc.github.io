This should actually be another category, 
but I am not sure in which direction I should bring this hexo blog on,
so I'll just write this here, like an exception.
<br><br>
Although I am really enjoying my experience with Jekyll,
I am also feeling a lot of it's limitations,
especially with implementing react into Jekyll,
as I found out and wrote it down in my previous post,
but it's hard to actually do it, because of webpack integration problem.
<br><br>
So even though I think this blog is great,
I would like to start another blog that can have 
react features more easily, and then I found Hexo.
<br><br>
Turns out that Hexo is actually more popular than Jekyll.. (I didn't know that!)
and also based on Node.js, which is the framework I am largely interested in 
right now.
<br><br>
So I decided to make another site,
actually make my base www.jinmc.github.io site with Hexo.
I am not sure what to make with that, but we'll see about it.
<br><br>
By the way, Hexo site was actually simpler and easier
than the Jekyll site, I think that was basically because 
I didn't have to deal with ruby versions.
<br><br>
So this is how I set up Hexo : https://github.com/hexojs/hexo
<br><br>
