While I was solving leetcode, 
I tried this code but gave me an error.

```

List<List<Integer>> al = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();

```

and I was surprised, because

```
List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>();
```

works perfectly.

So I looked up in stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24796273/incompatible-types-list-of-list-and-arraylist-of-arraylist

and figured out that this was not supposed to work.

It is also in [JavaDocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/subtype.html)

Long story short, 

We should do 

```
List<<List<Integer>> al = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
```

or 

```
List<<List<Inteer>> al = new ArrayList();
```
