Python is arguably the most hip language now.<br>
It is used for almost everything, but its popularity grew 
greatly with the boom of data science.<br>

Personally I started my programming with python.<br>
My impression, or memories with python is not all good 
because at that time I just started coding at that time.<br>
Looking back at the time from today, I didn't have the programming thinking at that time.<br>
