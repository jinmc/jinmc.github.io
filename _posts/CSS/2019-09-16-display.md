There are 4 types of display types, none, block, inline, and inline-block.

<ol>
  <li>none : this litterally means that it acts as it doesn't exist. </li>
  <li>block. This will make a new line, and it won't let another element should be after than this line.
      p element, which is paragraph is also naturally this display type. </li>
  <li>inline : The anchor tag is naturally this display type. It won't let you select the width or height,
             but it fits as the minimum width and height. In other words, it won't be on another line as new line. </li>
  <li>inline-block : The image is naturally this display block type. It acts as inline element but it lets you to set the height and width as you want. </li>
</ol>
