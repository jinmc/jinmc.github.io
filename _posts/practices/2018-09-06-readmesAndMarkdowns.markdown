Reference : Udacity's Writing READMEs course

Even this post is written in markdown as well as all other posts but 
I think I don't really appreciate the full functions of markdowns 
and also I should appreciate more readmes in every projects I've written.

And also, there are github flavored markdown,
and there's also the markdown I'm using now on this blog.

Github's markdown is especially important because that's the readme format
on github repositories.

There are some formats that we may use for readmes, such as 
how to install, examples, licenses, shields... 

Basic syntacs are, for hash signs, the number of it will decide the size of it like

#h1

##h2

###h3

I guess it does'nt work here.

But what works is that if I indent 4 lines, it automatically 
embed like code-style.

    this is not code.

even it's not code.

Also, you can make it itallic or bold by doing stars or underscores.. by github flavors,

**BOLD!**

_ITALIC~~_

seems like it also works here,

and there'se also inline code with single backticks... 

`code`

{% include disqus2.html %}
