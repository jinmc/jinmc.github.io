I think almost everyone has the urge to move his or her job.
In my company, because the business was not good enough,
we were paycut to 10 percent.

The atmosphere is almost shit.
I can't even believe that all employees are undergoing ten percent discount,
as I am sure that the wage differences would be huge among everyone.

Even apart from that, I figured it's time to move.
I have learned a lot here, but that was not due to other people.
I learned most of the coding practices and through internet, and taught myself through it.
