SQL queries are the most important syntax of the backend language.

Even though they are so important, the syntaxes of sql are quite different
from just regular programming languages like java and python.

Even the basic queries like if statements are different 
and hard to implement.

https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/control-flow-functions/case-operator.php

the Syntax is 

```
CASE value WHEN [compare_value] THEN result
[WHEN [compare_value] THEN result ...]
[ELSE result]
END
```

```
CASE WHEN [condition] THEN result
[WHEN [condition]
THEN result ...]
[ELSE result]
END
```
