To know if node is installed : 

		node -v

Update modules using : 

		npm install npm -g

Setting up a new project :

		npm init
		
This will make package.json, and make sure that index.js as the start point!

To make Node as a serverside framework, 
we have to use a web framework called Express.

To install Exrpess, simply type

		npm install express --save

It will show in package.json as a dependency.

It also helps to modularize the code and handle requests and responses.

An example of index.js will be 

		var express = require('express');
		var app = express();
		
		app.use('/', (req, res) => {
				res.send('hello node');
		});
		
		app.listen(3000, () => {
				console.log('Listening on port 3000');
		});

By the way, require means that we are using the 'express'
package.

Lastly, we just type 

		node index.js
		
and we can see hello node in localhost::3000
