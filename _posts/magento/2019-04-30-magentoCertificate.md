I took the Magento Associate Certificate on April 27, 2019.
I had to get 68 percent on the test but I got 38 percent instead.

For the Magento associate Certificate, 
those are the portion that should appear on the exam for each areas.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> Magento Architecture & Customization Techniques 33%
</li>
<li>Request Flow Processing 7%
</li>
<li>Customizing the Magento UI 15%
</li>
<li>Working with Databases in Magento 18%
</li>
<li>Developing with Adminhtml 11%
</li>
<li>Customizing Magento Business Logic 16%
</li>
<br>
And these are the test scores I got from the actual test.
<br><br>
<p>Overall Score: 38.33% </p>
Magento Architecture & Customization Techniques: 42.10%<br>
Request Flow Processing: 50.00%<br>
Customizing Magento UI: 55.55%<br>
Working with databases in Magento: 27.27%<br>
Developing with adminhtml : 14.28%<br>
Customizing Magento Business logic : 40.00%<br>
<br><br>
The result hurts a lot, but it actually helps in how I can prepare for the test.
<br>
The most resource I referred to when studying for the test
was alanstorm.com. Also, I looked up swiftotter guide itself 
and other blogs to prepare for the exam. 
I actually paid for the swiftotter practice exam and 
also two udemy courses. Looking back, I don't think udemy courses
helped, and alanstorm blogs helped a lot figuring out how magento works,
but not in the level to get me pass the associate exam.
<br><br>
After I took the exam, 
I feel that I need to take a look into the source code itself 
and actually understand it as how it actually works and what it does.
Especially, there was a lot of features on the test for the new
version features, namely, the GraphQl things.
<br><br>
To prepare more for the exam, I am going to attack more on the new features,
and also focus on the frontend, especially the layouts.
I notice the associate doesn't pay that much about 
javascript modules, but I should know the basics of it.
I also bought two online books, one is `No Frills Magento 2 Layout`
which contains a lot of frontend information of magento by Alan Storm.
One is a kindle book of `Magento 2 Developer's Guide` by Branko Ajzele.
