I've been focusing on html and css a lot.
I didn't pay much attention to it before,
but working with php laravel, different to web forms in .net,
we have full control of the view,
(but more work as well) so that means I should have to know
html and css like the back of my hand.

I'm now starting to pay my Karma coming back to me,
that I was lazy with those.

Not only that I have to get used to Html and CSS,
but also should be able to be good at certain libraries 
as well as backpack (laravel) and also front-end libraries
such as bootstrap and adminLte(which is custom-made css library..
