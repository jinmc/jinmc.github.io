BackPack is a library for Laravel.
For people like me that have difficulty creating forms,
this is a great library.

Not only making form is this useful,
but it has functionalities that are truly needed,
such as login and make permissions and roles to
characters.

To install Backpack, simply run
`$composer require backpack/crud`

and the composer will automatically run install backpack for you.

There are mainly two packages in Backpack,

First one is Backpack/base, which lets you to log in and register ids,
and the other is Backpack/CRUD, which lets you to make CRUD applications
and also make roles and permissions to characters.

If we install Backpack/CRUD,
Backpack/BASE will be installed automatically.

`$composer require backpack/crud` will do the trick.
