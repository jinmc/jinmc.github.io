Never knew about this, but we can lock in the level of hard drive!

As I work in a computer company, there are RMAs.. (Return merchandise authorization)
and some of them has harddrive locks in them.

As I 've never seen them before, I was really interested in them,
and even found out about linux and setting harddrive states.
We can use hdparm to set states!
