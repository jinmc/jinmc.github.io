I think almost everyone has the urge to move his or her job.
In my company, because the business was not good enough,
we were paycut to 10 percent.

The atmosphere is almost shit.
I can't even believe that all employees are undergoing ten percent discount,
as I am sure that the wage differences would be huge among everyone.

Even apart from that, I figured it's time to move.
I have learned a lot here, but that was not due to other people.
I learned most of the coding practices and through internet, and taught myself through it.

There are pros and cons to this, 
I mean, by doing everything myself, I could learn everything I want to the depth I want,
and also I could gain confidence from building everything from the scratch, but obviously, it's not fast paced.

And also, at first, it was fascinating to learn about the new technology,
but as it figures out, the technology I am using now isn't the cutting edge technology.. 
because our server is not able to handle cutting edge technology yet.

But it's hard... the hardest thing is that I am an F-1 VISA student working on OPT
right now so I have to find a company who would sponsor my H1B visa.. 

anyway, I'll write on next post about my interview...
