As learning Javascript, I couldn't agree more why it's gaining such spotlights..
First of all, it's fancy! 

Honestly, I'm not a good enough developer to argue which language is better than which,
but I can tell pros and cons from my point of view, but I certainly have preferences, from past experiences.

I certainly like C#, not just because it is similar to Java, but also because of the existence of wonderfully comfortable and powerful
 Visual Studio. And on the other side, JavaScript... this is still my least favorite language. There are many things to it,
 but the biggest thing is that it is really hard to debug. Also, next thing is that I'm not used to it!
 
 When I  write React Codes, I see bind everywhere when I want to connect the logic with the action actually doing it.
This could be a good example : 

{% highlight javascript %}
	

{% endhighlight %}

{% include disqus2.html %}
